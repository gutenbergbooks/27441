<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>This volume will, I hope, be found to contain
nearly all the genuine poetry in our language
fitted to please children,&mdash;of and from
the age at which they have usually learned
to read,&mdash;in common with grown people. A
collection on this plan has, I believe, never
before been made, although the value of the
principle seems clear.</p>

<p>The test applied, in every instance, in the
work of selection, has been that of having
actually pleased intelligent children; and my
object has been to make a book which shall
be to them no more nor less than a book of
equally good poetry is to intelligent grown
persons. The charm of such a book to the
latter class of readers is rather increased than
lessened by the surmised existence in it of
an unknown amount of power, meaning and
beauty, beyond that which is at once to be
seen; and children will not like this volume
the less because, though containing little or
nothing which will not at once please and
amuse them, it also contains much, the full
excellence of which they may not as yet be able
to understand.</p>

<p>The application of the practical test above
mentioned has excluded nearly all verse written
expressly for children, and most of the poetry
written about children for grown people. Hence,
the absence of several well-known pieces, which
some persons who examine this volume may
be surprised at not finding in it.</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of omitting portions
of a few poems, which would else have been too
long or otherwise unsuitable for the collection;
and, in a very few instances, I have ventured
to substitute a word or a phrase, when that
of the author has made the piece in which
it occurs unfit for children's reading. The
abbreviations I have been compelled to make
in the "Ancient Mariner," in order to bring
that poem within the limits of this collection,
are so considerable as to require particular
mention and apology.</p>

<p>No translations have been inserted but such
as, by their originality of style and modification
of detail, are entitled to stand as original
poems.</p>

<h3>THE CHILD AND THE PIPER</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Piping down the valleys wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Piping songs of pleasant glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a cloud I saw a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he, laughing, said to me,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Pipe a song about a lamb,'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So I piped with merry cheer;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sing thy songs of happy cheer.'<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Piper, sit thee down and write<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a book that all may read.'<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And I made a rural pen,<br /></span>

<h3>ON MAY MORNING</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the bright morning star, day's harbinger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes dancing from the east, and leads with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flow'ry May, who from her green lap throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow cowslip, and the pale primrose.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hail, bounteous May, that doth inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mirth and youth and warm desire!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Woods and groves are of thy dressing,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus we salute thee with our early song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcome thee, and wish thee long.<br /></span>

<h3>THE APPROACH OF THE FAIRIES</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the hungry lion roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the wolf behowls the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All with weary task foredone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the wasted brands do glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whilst the scritch owl, scritching loud,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Puts the wretch that lies in woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In remembrance of a shroud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now it is the time of night<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That the graves, all gaping wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every one lets forth his sprite,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the churchway paths to glide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we fairies, that do run,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the triple Hecate's team,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the presence of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Following darkness like a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now are frolic; not a mouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall disturb this hallowed house:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am sent with broom before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sweep the dust behind the door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the house give glimmering light;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the dead and drowsy fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every elf and fairy sprite,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hop as light as bird from brier;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this ditty after me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing and dance it trippingly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First rehearse this song by rote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each word a warbling note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hand in hand, with fairy grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will sing, and bless this place.<br /></span>

<h3>ANSWER TO A CHILD'S QUESTION</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do you ask what the birds say? The sparrow, the dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The linnet, and thrush say 'I love, and I love!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In the winter they're silent, the wind is so strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What it says I don't know, but it sings a loud song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But green leaves, and blossoms, and sunny warm weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing and loving&mdash;all come back together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lark is so brimful of gladness and love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green fields below him, the blue sky above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he sings, and he sings, and forever sings he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I love my Love, and my Love loves me.'<br /></span>

<h3>THE BROOK</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I come from haunts of coot and hern,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sparkle out among the fern,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bicker down a valley.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By thirty hills I hurry down,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or slip between the ridges,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till last by Philip's farm I flow<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I chatter over stony ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In little sharps and trebles,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With willow-weed and mallow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And here and there a foamy flake<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It is a mystery to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An archer, and yet blind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth I again, how can it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he his mark should find?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods, quoth she, whose will it was<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That he in something should surpass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To recompense their spite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave him this gift, though at his game<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He still shot in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he should have so certain aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As not to miss his mark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this time we were come ashore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When me my fare she paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a word she utter'd more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor had I her bewray'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venus nor of Cupid I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before did never hear,<br /></span>

<h3>EPITAPH ON A HARE</h3>

<span class="i2">Nor swifter greyhound follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose foot ne'er tainted morning dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor ear heard huntsman's hallo!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, nurs'd with tender care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to domestic bounds confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was still a wild Jack-hare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though duly from my hand he took<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His pittance every night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did it with a jealous look,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, when he could, would bite.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His diet was of wheaten bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And milk, and oats, and straw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thistles, or lettuces instead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With sand to scour his maw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On pippin's russet peel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when his juicy salads failed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sliced carrot pleased him well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Turkey carpet was his lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereon he loved to bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To skip and gambol like a fawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And swing himself around.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His frisking was at evening hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For then he lost his fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most before approaching showers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or when a storm drew near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eight years and five round-rolling moons<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He thus saw steal away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dozing out all his idle noons,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And every night at play.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I kept him for his humours' sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he would oft beguile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart of thoughts that made it ache,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And force me to a smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now, beneath this walnut shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He finds his long last home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waits, in snug concealment laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till gentler Puss shall come.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He, still more aged, feels the shocks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From which no care can save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, partner once of Tiney's box,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Must soon partake his grave.<br /></span>

<h3>ABOU BEN ADHEM AND THE ANGEL</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An angel writing in a book of gold:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the Presence in the room he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What writest thou?'&mdash;The vision raised its head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a look made of all sweet accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer'd, 'The names of those who love the Lord.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And is mine one?' said Abou. 'Nay, not so,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied the Angel. Abou spoke more low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cheerly still; and said, 'I pray thee then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Write me as one that loves his fellow men.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The angel wrote and vanished. The next night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It came again with a great wakening light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show'd the names whom love of God had bless'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Speed!' echoed the wall to us galloping through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the midnight we galloped abreast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Twas moonset at starting; but, while we drew near<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At D&uuml;ffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Joris broke silence with, 'Yet there is time!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And against him the cattle stood black every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stare through the mist at us galloping past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw my stout galloper, Roland, at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With resolute shoulders each butting away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one eye's black intelligence,&mdash;ever that glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, 'Stay spur!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll remember at Aix'&mdash;for one heard the quick wheeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her chest, saw the stretched neck, and staggering knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>

<span class="i0">The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath our foot broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till over by Dalhem a dome-tower sprang white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'Gallop,' cried Joris, 'for Aix is in sight!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How they'll greet us!' and all in a moment his roan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I cast my loose buff-coat, each holster let fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called my Roland his pet name, my horse without peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all I remember is friends flocking round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I sate with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)<br /></span>

<h3>THE RAVEN AND THE OAK</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Underneath an old oak tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was of swine a huge company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grunted as they crunch'd the mast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that was ripe and fell full fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they trotted away, for the wind it grew high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One acorn they left and no more might you spy.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Next came a Raven that liked not such folly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He belonged, they did say, to the witch Melancholy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blacker was he than blackest jet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew low in the rain and his feathers not wet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He picked up the acorn and buried it straight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of a river both deep and great.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Where then did the Raven go?<br /></span>
<span class="i8">He went high and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over hill, over dale, did the black Raven go.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Many autumns, many springs<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Travelled he with wandering wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Many summers, many winters&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">I can't tell half his adventures.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length he came back, and with him a she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the acorn was grown to a tall oak tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They built them a nest in the topmost bough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And young ones they had and were happy enow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon came a woodman in leathern guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brow, like a pent house, hung over his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd an axe in his hand, not a word he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with many a hem! and a sturdy stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he brought down the poor Raven's old oak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His young ones were killed, for they could not depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their mother did die of a broken heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boughs from the trunk the woodman did sever;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they floated it down on the course of the river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sawed it in planks, and its bark they did strip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with this tree and others they made a good ship.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The ship it was launched; but in sight of the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a storm there did rise as no ship could withstand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It bulged on a rock, and the waves rushed in fast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round and round flew the Raven and cawed to the blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard the last shriek of the perishing souls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! see! o'er the top-mast the mad water rolls!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Right glad was the Raven, and off he went fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death riding home on a cloud he did meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thanked him again and again for this treat:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They had taken his all, and revenge it was sweet.<br /></span>

<h3>THE SPANISH ARMADA</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Attend all ye who list to hear our noble England's praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell of the thrice famous deeds she wrought in ancient days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that great fleet invincible against her bore in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts of Spain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was about the lovely close of a warm summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crew hath seen Castile's black fleet beyond Aurigny's isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sunrise she escaped their van, by God's especial grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held her close in chase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgcumbe's lofty hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With his white hair unbonneted the stout old sheriff comes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him march the halberdiers, before him sound the drums;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His yeomen, round the market-cross, make clear an ample space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there behoves him to set up the standard of her Grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As slow upon the labouring wind the royal blazon swells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look how the lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stalked he when he turned to flight on that famed Picard field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bohemia's plume, and Genoa's bow, and C&aelig;sar's eagle shield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crushed and torn beneath his paws the princely hunters lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! strike the flag-staff deep, Sir Knight; ho! scatter flowers, fair maids:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! gunners fire a loud salute: ho! gallants, draw your blades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sun, shine on her joyously; ye breezes waft her wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our glorious SEMPER EADEM, the banner of our pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner's massy fold,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night sank upon the dusky beach, and on the purple sea,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such night in England ne'er had been, nor ne'er again shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on St. Michael's Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar's glittering waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip's sunless caves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Longleat's towers, o'er Cranbourne's oaks, the fiery herald flew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the day three hundred horse had met on Clifton down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw, o'erhanging Richmond Hill, the streak of blood-red light.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then bugle's note and cannon's roar the death-like silence broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the loud alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the furthest wards was heard the rush of hurrying feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broad streams of flags and pikes rushed down each roaring street:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fast from every village round the horse came spurring in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eastward straight, from wild Blackheath, the warlike errant went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Southward, from Surrey's pleasant hills flew those bright couriers forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on bleak Hampstead's swarthy moor they started for the North;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o'er Darwin's rocky dales,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till like volcanoes flared to Heaven the stormy hills of Wales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern's lonely height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin's crest of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till broad and fierce the star came forth on Ely's stately fane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tower and hamlet rose in arms o'er all the boundless plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Belvoir's lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lincoln sped the message on o'er the wide vale of Trent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt's embattled pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red glare of Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A rout this morning left Sir Walter's Hall,<br /></span>

<h3>THE SUMMER SHOWER</h3>

<span class="i2">The wild birds sit listening the drops round them beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boy crouches close to the blackberry wall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The swallows alone take the storm on their wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, taunting the tree-sheltered labourers, sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like pebbles the rain breaks the face of the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While a bubble darts up from each widening ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boy in dismay hears the loud shower fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But soon are the harvesters tossing their sheaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The robin darts out from his bower of leaves;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And the rain-spatter'd urchin now gladly perceives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the beautiful bow bendeth over them all.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O, what could it grieve for? Its feet were tied<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a silken thread of my own hands' weaving;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet little red feet! why should you die&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why would you leave me, sweet bird! why?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You lived alone in the forest tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, pretty thing! would you not live with me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I kiss'd you oft and gave you white peas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Old Goody Blake was old and poor;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Remote from sheltered village green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a hill's northern side she dwelt,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O joy for her! whene'er in winter<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As every man who knew her says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pile beforehand, turf or stick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to warm her for three days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, when the frost was past enduring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Could any thing be more alluring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now and then, it must be said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When her old bones were cold and chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She left her fire, or left her bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Harry he had long suspected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This trespass of old Goody Blake;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He watched to seize old Goody Blake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And once behind a rick of barley,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The moon was full and shining clearly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crisp with frost the stubble land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;He hears a noise&mdash;he's all awake&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again?&mdash;on tip-toe down the hill<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She's at the hedge of Harry Gill!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Right glad was he when he beheld her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stick after stick did Goody pull:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood behind a bush of elder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she had fill'd her apron full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with her load she turned about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The by-way back again to take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He started forward with a shout,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And fiercely by the arm he took her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the arm he held her fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiercely by the arm he shook her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, 'I've caught you then at last!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Goody who had nothing said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bundle from her lap let fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kneeling on the sticks she prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God that is the judge of all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She prayed, her withered hand uprearing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'God, who art never out of hearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O may he never more be warm!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold, cold moon above her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus on her knees did Goody pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Harry heard what she had said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And icy cold he turned away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He went complaining all the morrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was cold and very chill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that day for Harry Gill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day he wore a riding coat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a whit the warmer he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another was on Thursday bought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the Sabbath he had three.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas all in vain, a useless matter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blankets were about him pinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still his jaws and teeth they chatter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a loose casement in the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Harry's flesh it fell away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who see him say 'tis plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That live as long as live he may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never will be warm again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No word to any man he utters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-bed or up, to young or old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever to himself he mutters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Poor Harry Gill is very cold!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-bed or up, by night or day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His teeth they chatter, chatter still.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">On horseback after we.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He soon replied, 'I do admire<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Therefore it shall be done.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I am a linen-draper bold,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, 'That's well said;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And for that wine is dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will be furnish'd with our own,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which is both bright and clear.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'erjoy'd was he to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, though on pleasure she was bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She had a frugal mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morning came, the chaise was brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But yet was not allowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive up to the door, lest all<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should say that she was proud.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where they did all get in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six precious souls, and all agog<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To dash through thick and thin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were never folk so glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stones did rattle underneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if Cheapside were mad.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Gilpin, at his horse's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seiz'd fast the flowing mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up he got, in haste to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soon came down again;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His journey to begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, turning round his head, he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Three customers come in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So down he came; for loss of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Although it grieved him sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would trouble him much more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas long before the customers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were suited to their mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Betty, screaming, came downstairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'The wine is left behind!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Good lack!' quoth he, 'yet bring it me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My leathern belt likewise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which I bear my trusty sword<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When I do exercise.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now mistress Gilpin, (careful soul!)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had two stone-bottles found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold the liquor that she loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And keep it safe and sound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Each bottle had a curling ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through which the belt he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung a bottle on each side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To make his balance true.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then over all, that he might be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Equipp'd from top to toe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His long red cloak, well brush'd and neat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He manfully did throw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now see him mounted once again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon his nimble steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With caution and good heed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But finding soon a smoother road<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath his well-shod feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snorting beast began to trot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which gall'd him in his seat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, 'Fair and softly,' John he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But John he cried in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That trot became a gallop soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In spite of curb and rein.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So stooping down, as needs he must<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who cannot sit upright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eke, with all his might.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His horse, who never in that sort<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had handled been before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thing upon his back had got<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did wonder more and more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Away went hat and wig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He little dreamt, when he set out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of running such a rig.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like streamer long and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till loop and button failing both,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At last it flew away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then might all people well discern<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bottles he had slung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bottle swinging at each side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As hath been said or sung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Up flew the windows all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every soul cried out, Well done!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As loud as he could bawl.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His fame soon spread around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He carries weight! he rides a race!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis for a thousand pound!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And still as fast as he drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas wonderful to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in a trice the turnpike men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their gates wide open threw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, as he went bowing down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His reeking head full low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bottles twain behind his back<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were shatter'd at a blow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Down ran the wine into the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Most piteous to be seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made his horse's flanks to smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As they had basted been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But still he seem'd to carry weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With leathern girdle braced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all might see the bottle necks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still dangling at his waist.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus all through merry Islington<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These gambols he did play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he came unto the Wash<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Edmonton so gay;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there he threw the wash about<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On both sides of the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just like unto a trundling mop,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or a wild goose at play.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Edmonton his loving wife<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the balcony spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tender husband, wondering much<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see how he did ride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They all aloud did cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The dinner waits, and we are tired;'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said Gilpin, 'So am I!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But yet his horse was not a whit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Inclin'd to tarry there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For why? his owner had a house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full ten miles off, at Ware.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So like an arrow swift he flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shot by an archer strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The middle of my song.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin, out of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sore against his will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, at his friend the Calender's,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His horse at last stood still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Calender, amazed to see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His neighbour in such trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thus accosted him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'What news? what news? your tidings tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell me you must and shall&mdash;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And loved a timely joke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, unto the Calender,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In merry guise he spoke:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I came because your horse would come;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, if I well forebode,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">They are upon the road.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Calender, right glad to find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His friend in merry pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return'd him not a single word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But to the house went in;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whence straight he came, with hat and wig,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A wig that flowed behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hat not much the worse for wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each comely in its kind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He held them up, and in his turn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus show'd his ready wit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My head is twice as big as yours,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They therefore needs must fit.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But let me scrape the dust away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That hangs upon your face;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Said John, 'It is my wedding-day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So, turning to his horse, he said,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">You shall go back for mine.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For which he paid full dear;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Did sing most loud and clear;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whereat his horse did snort, as he<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Away went Gilpin, and away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went Gilpin's hat and wig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lost them sooner than at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For why?&mdash;they were too big.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Mrs. Gilpin, when she saw<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The youth did ride, and soon did meet<br /></span>

<h3>SIR SIDNEY SMITH</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gentlefolks, in my time, I've made many a rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the song I now trouble you with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lays some claim to applause, and you'll grant it, because<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The subject's Sir Sidney Smith, it is;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The subject's Sir Sidney Smith.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We all know Sir Sidney, a man of such kidney,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'd fight every foe he could meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give him one ship or two, and without more ado,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'd engage if he met a whole fleet, he would;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'd engage if he met a whole fleet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus he took, every day, all that came in his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till fortune, that changeable elf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Order'd accidents so, that, while taking the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sir Sidney got taken himself, he did;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sir Sidney got taken himself.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His captors, right glad of the prize they now had,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rejected each offer we bid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swore he should stay, lock'd up till doomsday,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he swore he'd be hang'd if he did, he did;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So Sir Sid got away, and his gaoler next day<br /></span>

<h3>THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By famous Hanover city;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The river Weser deep and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Washes its walls on the southern side;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A pleasanter spot you never spied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when begins my ditty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Almost five hundred years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see the townsfolk suffer so<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From vermin, was a pity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Rats!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fought the dogs and killed the cats,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bit the babies in their cradles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate the cheeses out of the vats,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Split open the kegs of salted sprats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even spoiled the women's chats,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">By drowning their speaking<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With shrieking and squeaking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fifty different sharps and flats.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the people in a body<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the Town-hall came flocking:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">''Tis clear,' cried they, 'our Mayor's a noddy:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as for our Corporation&mdash;shocking<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For dolts that can't or won't determine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What's best to rid us of our vermin!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You hope, because you're old and obese,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To find in the furry civic robe ease!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Rouse up, Sirs! Give your brains a racking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the remedy we're lacking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this the Mayor and Corporation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quaked with a mighty consternation.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An hour they sat in council,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At length the Mayor broke silence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wish I were a mile hence!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's easy to bid one rack one's brain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm sure my poor head aches again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've scratched it so, and all in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as he said this, what should hap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the chamber door, but a gentle tap?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bless us,' cried the Mayor, 'what's that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anything like the sound of a rat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come in!' the Mayor cried, looking bigger:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in did come the strangest figure!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His queer long coat from heel to head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was half of yellow, and half of red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he himself was tall and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sharp blue eyes each like a pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tuft on cheek, nor beard on chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lips where smiles went out and in&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no guessing his kith and kin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nobody could enough admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall man and his quaint attire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth one, 'It's as if my great-grandsire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starting up at the trump of Doom's tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He advanced to the council table:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, 'Please your honours,' said he, 'I'm able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By means of a secret charm, to draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All creatures living beneath the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That creep, or swim, or fly, or run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After me so as you never saw!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I chiefly use my charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On creatures that do people harm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mole, the toad, the newt, the viper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And people call me the Pied Piper.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet,' said he, 'poor piper as I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Tartary I freed the Cham,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last June, from his huge swarm of gnats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I eased in Asia the Nizam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a monstrous brood of vampyre bats:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as for what your brain bewilders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I can rid your town of rats<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will you give me a thousand guilders?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'One? fifty thousand!' was the exclamation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Into the street the Piper stept,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Smiling first a little smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if he knew what magic slept<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In his quiet pipe the while;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then like a musical adept,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a candle flame where salt is sprinkled;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ere three shrill notes the pipe had uttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You heard as if an army muttered;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the muttering grew to a grumbling;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocking tails, and pricking whiskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Families by tens and dozens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the Piper for their lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From street to street he piped, advancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And step for step they followed dancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until they came to the river Weser<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein all plunged and perished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save one, who stout as Julius C&aelig;sar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swam across, and lived to carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As <i>he</i> the manuscript he cherished)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rat-land home his commentary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was, 'At the first shrill notes of the pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And putting apples wondrous ripe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a cider press's gripe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a moving away of pickle-tub boards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a leaving ajar of conserve cupboards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a breaking the hoops of butter casks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as if a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is breathed) called out, Oh rats, rejoice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breakfast, dinner, supper, luncheon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as a bulky sugar puncheon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ready staved, like a great sun shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious, scarce an inch before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as methought it said, "Come, bore me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I found the Weser rolling o'er me.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<span class="i0">You should have heard the Hamelin people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Go,' cried the Mayor, 'and get long poles!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poke out the nests, and block up the holes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consult with carpenters and builders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave in our town not even a trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the rats!' When suddenly up the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Piper perked in the market-place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a 'First, if you please, my thousand guilders!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So did the Corporation too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For council dinners made rare havock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half the money would replenish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay this sum to a wandering fellow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a gipsy coat of red and yellow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Besides,' quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Our business was done at the river's brink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what's dead can't come to life, I think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the duty of giving you something for drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a matter of money to put in your poke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as for the guilders, what we spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of them, as you very well know, was in joke&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside, our losses have made us thrifty:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand guilders! come, take fifty!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Piper's face fell, and he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'No trifling! I can't wait beside!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've promised to visit by dinner-time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bagdat, and accept the prime<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of the head-cook's pottage, all he's rich in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For having left in the caliph's kitchen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a nest of scorpions no surviver.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him I proved no bargain-driver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folks who put me in a passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May find me pipe to another fashion.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How?' cried the Mayor, 'd'ye think I'll brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being worse treated than a cook?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insulted by a lazy ribald<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With idle pipe and vesture piebald?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow your pipe there till you burst.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once more he stept into the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to his lips again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid his long pipe of smooth, straight cane;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ere he blew three notes (such sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft notes as yet musician's cunning<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Never gave the enraptured air),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out came the children running:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the little boys and girls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tripping and skipping ran merrily after<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they were changed into blocks of wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to move a step, or cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the children merrily skipping by&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could only follow with the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the Mayor was on the rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Piper turned from the High Street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Weser rolled its waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However he turned from south to west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after him the children pressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great was the joy in every breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He never can cross that mighty top;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's forced to let the piping drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall see our children stop!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, lo! as they reached the mountain's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wondrous portal opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Piper advanced, and the children followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when all were in to the very last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door in the mountain side shut fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I say, all? No! One was lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not dance the whole of the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in after years, if you would blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sadness, he was used to say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It's dull in our town since my playmates left!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't forget that I'm bereft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the pleasant sights they see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the Piper also promised me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joining the town and just at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything was strange and new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their dogs outran our fallow-deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honey-bees had lost their stings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And horses were born with eagles' wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as I became assured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lame foot would be speedily cured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music stopped and I stood still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found myself outside the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left alone against my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go now limping as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never hear of that country more!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Mayor sent east, west, north, and south<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To offer the Piper by word of mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wherever it was man's lot to find him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silver and gold to his heart's content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he'd only return the way he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bring the children behind him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Piper and dancers were gone for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made a decree that lawyers never<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should think their records dated duly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If after the day of the month and year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These words did not as well appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'And so long after what happened here<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the twenty-second of July,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the better in memory to fix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place of the children's last retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They called it, the Pied Piper's Street&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where any one playing on pipe or tabor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sure for the future to lose his labour.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To shock with mirth a street so solemn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But opposite the place of the cavern<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They wrote the story on a column,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the great church window painted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same, to make the world acquainted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How their children were stolen away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there it stands to this very day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I must not omit to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in Transylvania there's a tribe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of alien people, that ascribe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The outlandish ways and dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which their neighbours lay such stress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their fathers and mothers having risen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of some subterraneous prison<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into which they were trepanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ago in a mighty band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how or why, they don't understand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Willy, let you and me be wipers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scores out with all men,&mdash;especially pipers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An ancient story I'll tell you anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a notable prince, that was called King John;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he ruled England with main and with might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he did great wrong and maintain'd little right.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I'll tell you a story, a story so merry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning the Abbot of Canterbury;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How for his housekeeping and high renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rode post for him to fair London town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An hundred men, the king did hear say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Abbot kept in his house every day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fifty gold chains, without any doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In velvet coats waited the Abbot about.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'How now, father Abbot; I hear it of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou keepest a far better house than me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for thy housekeeping and high renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear thou work'st treason against my crown.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My liege,' quoth the Abbot, 'I would it were known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never spend nothing but what is my own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I trust your grace will do me no deere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For spending of my own true gotten geere.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yes, yes, father Abbot, thy fault it is high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now for the same thou needest must die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For except thou canst answer me questions three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy head shall be smitten from thy bodie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And first,' quoth the king, 'when I'm in this stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my crown of gold so fair on my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among all my liege-men so noble of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Secondly tell me, without any doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon I may ride the whole world about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the third question thou must not shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me here truly what I do think.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O these are hard questions for my shallow wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor I cannot answer your Grace as yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you will give me but three weeks space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll do my endeavour to answer your Grace.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now three weeks space to thee will I give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that is the longest time thou hast to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if thou dost not answer my questions three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to me.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Away rode the Abbot all sad at that word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode to Cambridge and Oxenford;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never a doctor there was so wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That could with his learning an answer devise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then home rode the Abbot of comfort so cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he met his shepherd a going to fold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'How now, my lord Abbot, you are welcome home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What news do you bring us from good King John?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Sad news, sad news, shepherd, I must give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I have but three days more to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if I do not answer him questions three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My head will be smitten from my bodie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The first is to tell him there in that stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his crown of gold so fair on his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among all his liege-men so noble of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To within one penny of what he is worth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The second, to tell him without any doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon he may ride this whole world about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the third question I must not shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell him there truly what he does think.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now cheer up, sir Abbot, did you never hear yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a fool he may learn a wise man wit?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lend me horse, and serving men, and your apparel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'll ride to London to answer your quarrel.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nay, frown not, if it hath been told unto me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am like your lordship as ever may be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you will but lend me your gown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is none shall know us in fair London town.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Now horses and serving men thou shalt have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sumptuous array most gallant and brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crozier, and mitre, and rochet, and cope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit to appear 'fore our father the Pope.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now welcome, sir Abbot,' the King he did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">''Tis well thou'rt come back to keep thy day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For and if thou canst answer my questions three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy life and thy living both saved shall be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And first, when thou seest me here in this stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my crown of gold so fair on my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among all my liege-men so noble of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me to one penny what I am worth.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For thirty pence our Saviour was sold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the false Jews, as I have been told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twenty-nine is the worth of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I think thou art one penny worser than he.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King he laugh'd, and swore by St. Bittel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I did not think I had been worth so little!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now secondly tell me, without any doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon I may ride this whole world about.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the next morning he riseth again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then your Grace need not make any doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King he laugh'd, and swore by St. Jone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I did not think it could be gone so soon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from the third question thou must not shrink,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You think I'm the Abbot of Canterbury;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I'm his poor shepherd, as plain you may see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That am come to beg pardon for him and for me.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King he laugh'd, and swore by the mass,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For alack, I can neither write nor read.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Four nobles a week, then, I will give thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this merry jest thou hast shewn unto me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell the old Abbot, when thou com'st home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John.'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then turn'd and knelt beside it in the place,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Sultan said, with much humanity,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I could not rid me of a dread that one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whom such daring villanies were done,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For this I had the light put out. But when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the face and found a stranger slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knelt and thank'd the sovereign arbiter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose work I had perform'd through pain and fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then I rose and was refresh'd with food,<br /></span>

<h3>THE RAVEN</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">''Tis some visitor,' I mutter'd, 'tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Only this and nothing more.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eagerly I wish'd the morrow;&mdash;vainly had I sought to borrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Nameless here for evermore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrill'd me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that now to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">This it is, and nothing more.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sir,' said I, 'or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I scarce was sure I heard you;' here I open'd wide the door;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Darkness there, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the only word there spoken was the whisper'd word 'Lenore!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I whisper'd, and an echo murmur'd back the word 'Lenore'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Merely this, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me see then what thereat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">'Tis the wind, and nothing more!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Open here I flung a shutter, when with many a flirt and flutter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In there stepp'd a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopp'd or stay'd he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with mien of lord or lady, perch'd above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perch'd upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Perch'd and sat and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Much I marvell'd this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bird or beast upon the sculptur'd bust above his chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With such a name as 'Nevermore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing farther then he utter'd&mdash;not a feather then he flutter'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I scarcely more than mutter'd, 'Other friends have flown before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then the bird said 'Nevermore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow'd fast and follow'd faster, till his songs one burden bore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of 'Never&mdash;nevermore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight I wheel'd a cushion'd seat in front of bird, and bust, and door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burnt into my bosom's core;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">''Tis pleasant,' cried one, 'seated by the fireside<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To hear the wind whistle without.'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Methinks a man's courage would now be well tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who should wander the ruins about.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I myself, like a schoolboy, should tremble to hear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some ugly old abbot's grim spirit appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For this wind might awaken the dead!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I'll wager a dinner,' the other one cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'That Mary would venture there now.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Then wager and lose!' with a sneer he replied,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His companion exclaimed with a smile;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the elder that grows in the aisle.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With fearless good-humour did Mary comply,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And her way to the Abbey she bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night was dark, and the wind was high,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She shiver'd with cold as she went.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O'er the path so well known still proceeded the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the Abbey rose dim on the sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the gateway she enter'd, she felt not afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All around her was silent save when the rude blast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Howl'd dismally round the old pile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over weed-cover'd fragments she fearlessly passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arrived at the innermost ruin at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the elder-tree grew in the aisle.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hastily gather'd the bough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paus'd, and she listen'd intently, in fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And her heart panted painfully now.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She listen'd, nought else could she hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind fell; her heart sunk in her bosom with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of footsteps approaching her near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behind a wide column half breathless with fear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She crept to conceal herself there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And between them a corpse they did bear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then Mary could feel the heart-blood curdle cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Again the rough wind hurried by&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It blew off the hat of the one, and behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She felt, and expected to die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Curse the hat!' he exclaims. 'Nay, come on till we hide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The dead body,' his comrade replies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She beholds them in safety pass on by her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fast through the Abbey she flies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She gazed in her terror around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then her limbs could support their faint burden no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exhausted and breathless she sank on the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unable to utter a sound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a moment the hat met her view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes from that object convulsively start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For&mdash;what a cold horror then thrill'd through her heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the name of her Richard she knew!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where the old Abbey stands, on the Common hard by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His gibbet is now to be seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His irons you still from the road may espy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traveller beholds them, and thinks with a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of poor Mary, the Maid of the Inn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To try good people's hospitality.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It happen'd on a winter night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As authors of the legend write,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two brother hermits, saints by trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking their tour in masquerade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguis'd in tatter'd habits went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a small village down in Kent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in the stroller's canting strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They begg'd from door to door in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Tried every tone might pity win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a soul would take them in.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our wandering saints, in woful state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treated at this ungodly rate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To a small cottage came at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dwelt a good old honest yeoman<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While he from out the chimney took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flitch of bacon off the hook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And freely from the fattest side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut out large slices to be fried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stepp'd aside to fetch them drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill'd a large jug up to the brink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw it fairly twice go round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet (what is wonderful!) they found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas still replenish'd to the top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they ne'er had touch'd a drop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good old couple were amaz'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often on each other gaz'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For both were frightened to the heart,<br /></span>

<h3>THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old stories tell how Hercules<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A dragon slew at Lerna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With seven heads and fourteen eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see and well discern-a:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he had a club, this dragon to drub,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or he ne'er had done it, I warrant ye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But More of More-hall, with nothing at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He slew the dragon of Wantley.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This dragon had two furious wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each one upon each shoulder;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a sting in his tail as long as a flail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which made him bolder and bolder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had long claws, and in his jaws<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Four and forty teeth of iron;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a hide as tough as any buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which did him round environ.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have you not heard how the Trojan horse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Held seventy men in his belly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dragon was not quite so big,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But very near, I'll tell ye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devour'd he poor children three,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That could not with him grapple;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at one sup he ate them up,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As one would eat an apple.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All sorts of cattle this dragon would eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some say he ate up trees,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And that the forests sure he would<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Devour up by degrees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For houses and churches were to him geese and turkies;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He ate all and left none behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some stones, dear Jack, that he could not crack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which on the hills you will find.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hard by a furious knight there dwelt;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Men, women, girls, and boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighing and sobbing, came to his lodging,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And made a hideous noise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O save us all, More of More-hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou peerless knight of these woods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do but slay this dragon, who won't leave us a rag on,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll give thee all our goods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This being done, he did engage<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To hew the dragon down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first he went new armour to<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bespeak at Sheffield town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spikes all about, not within but without,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of steel so sharp and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both behind and before, arms, legs, and all o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some five or six inches long.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had you but seen him in this dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How fierce he look'd, and how big,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would have thought him for to be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some Egyptian porcupig:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He frighted all, cats, dogs, and all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each cow, each horse, and each hog:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear they did flee, for they took him to be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some strange, outlandish hedge-hog.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To see this fight all people then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Got up on trees and houses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On churches some, and chimneys too;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But these put on their trousers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to spoil their hose. As soon as he rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To make him strong and mighty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drank, by the tale, six pots of ale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a quart of aqua-vit&aelig;.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is not strength that always wins,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For wit doth strength excel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made our cunning champion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Creep down into a well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he did think this dragon would drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so he did in truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he stoop'd low, he rose up and cried, boh!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kick'd him in the mouth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, quoth the dragon with a deep sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And turn'd six times together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sobbing and tearing, cursing and swearing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out of his throat of leather:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More of More-hall, O thou rascal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would I had seen thee never;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the thing at thy foot thou hast prick'd my throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I'm quite undone for ever.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Murder, murder, the dragon cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alack, alack, for grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had you but miss'd that place, you could<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have done me no mischief.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then his head he shaked, trembled and quaked,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And down he laid and cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First on one knee, then on back tumbled he;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So groan'd, and kick'd, and died.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At dead of night, when mortals lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their various cares in soft repose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I took a lamp, and oped the gate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, see! a naked boy before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The threshold; at his back he wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pair of wings, and by his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crooked bow and quiver tied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My pretty angel! come,' said I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Come to the fire, and do not cry.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stroked his neck and shoulders bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And squeez'd the water from his hair;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then chafed his little hands in mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheer'd him with a draught of wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recover'd thus, says he, 'I'd know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the rain has spoilt my bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let's try'&mdash;then shot me with a dart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The venom throbb'd, did ache and smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a bee had stung my heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Are these your thanks, ungrateful child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these your thanks?' The impostor smiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Farewell, my loving host,' says he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All's well; my bow's unhurt, I see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what a wretch I've made of thee!'<br /></span>

<h3>THE COLUBRIAD</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Close by the threshold of a door nail'd fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three kittens sat; each kitten look'd aghast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, passing swift and inattentive by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the three kittens cast a careless eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not much concern'd to know what they did there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not deeming kittens worth a Poet's care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But presently a loud and furious hiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caused me to stop, and to exclaim, 'What's this?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo! upon the threshold met my view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With head erect, and eyes of fiery hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A viper, long as Count de Grasse's queue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from his head his forked tongue he throws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darting it full against a kitten's nose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who having never seen, in field or house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The like, sat still and silent as a mouse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only projecting, with attention due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her whisker'd face, she asked him, 'Who are you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to the hall went I, with pace not slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But swift as lightning, for a long Dutch hoe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which well arm'd I hasten'd to the spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the viper, but I found him not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, turning up the leaves and shrubs around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found only, that he was not to be found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the kitten, sitting as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat watching close the bottom of the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I hope,' said I, 'the villain I would kill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has slipp'd between the door and the door-sill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I make despatch, and follow hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt but I shall find him in the yard;'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For long ere now it should have been rehearsed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas in the garden that I found him first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even there I found him&mdash;there the full-grown cat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head, with velvet paw, did gently pat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As curious as the kittens each had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To learn what this phenomenon might mean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill'd with heroic ardour at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fearing every moment he would bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rob our household of our only cat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was of age to combat with a rat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With outstretch'd hoe I slew him at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And taught him never to come thither more.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He stood with his head in the mulberry-tree,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And down went the priest in the wild-briar bush.<br /></span>

<h3>DORA</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With farmer Allan at the farm abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">William and Dora. William was his son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she his niece. He often look'd at them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often thought, 'I'll make them man and wife.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yearn'd towards William; but the youth, because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had been always with her in the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought not of Dora.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
<span class="i16">Then there came a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Allan call'd his son, and said: 'My son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I married late, but I would wish to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My grandchild on my knees before I die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have set my heart upon a match.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore look to Dora; she is well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look to; thrifty too, beyond her age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is my brother's daughter: he and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had once hard words, and parted, and he died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many years.' But William answer'd short:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I cannot marry Dora; by my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not marry Dora.' Then the old man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in my time a father's word was law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so it shall be now for me. Look to't;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider, William; take a month to think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me have an answer to my wish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nevermore darken my doors again!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But William answer'd madly, bit his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broke away. The more he look'd at her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dora bore them meekly. Then before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The month was out he left his father's house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hired himself to work within the fields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A labourer's daughter, Mary Morrison.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His niece and said: 'My girl, I love you well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you speak with him that was my son,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or change a word with her he calls his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My home is none of yours. My will is law.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And days went on, and there was born a boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To William; then distresses came on him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken, and his father help'd him not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dora stored what little she could save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sent it; till at last a fever seized<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On William, and in harvest-time he died.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I have obey'd my uncle until now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have sinn'd, for it was all through me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This evil came on William at the first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for your sake, the woman that he chose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this orphan, I am come to you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know there has not been for these five years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So full a harvest: let me take the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will set him in my uncle's eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the wheat; that, when his heart is glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Dora took the child, and went her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was unsown, where many poppies grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off the farmer came into the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spied her not; for none of all his men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dora would have risen and gone to him,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when the morrow came, she rose and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child once more, and sat upon the mound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a little wreath of all the flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grew about, and tied it on his hat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when the farmer pass'd into the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spied her, and he left his men at work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came and said, 'Where were you yesterday?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose child is that? what are you doing here?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answer'd softly, 'This is William's child.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And did I not,' said Allan, 'did I not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid you, Dora?' Dora said again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Do with me as you will, but take the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Allan said: 'I see it is a trick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got up betwixt you and the woman there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must be taught my duty, and by you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You knew my word was law, and yet you dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slight it. Well&mdash;for I will take the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But go you hence, and never see me more.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boy's cry came to her from the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More and more distant. She bow'd down her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering the day when first she came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the things that had been. She bow'd down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wept in secret; and the reapers reap'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell and all the land was dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God that help'd her in her widowhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dora said: 'My uncle took the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, let me live and work with you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says that he will never see me more.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then answer'd Mary, 'This shall never be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he will teach him hardness, and to slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother: therefore thou and I will go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will have my boy, and bring him home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will beg of him to take thee back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he will not take thee back again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thou and I will live within one house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And work for William's child until he grows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of age to help us.'<br /></span>
<span class="i16">So the women kiss'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each other, and set out and reach'd the farm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door was off the latch; they peep'd and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one that loved him: and the lad stretch'd out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And babbled for the golden seal that hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they came in; but when the boy beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother, he cried out to come to her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Allan sat him down, and Mary said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O Father!&mdash;if you let me call me so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never came a-begging for myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or William, or this child; but now I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Dora: take her back; she loves you well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sir, when William died, he died at peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all men; for I ask'd him, and he said,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He could not ever rue his marrying me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was wrong to cross his father thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God bless him!" he said, "and may he never know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troubles I have gone through!" then he turn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face and pass'd&mdash;unhappy that I am!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father's memory; and take Dora back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let all this be as it was before.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So Mary said, and Dora hid her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Mary. There was silence in the room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once the old man burst in sobs:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I have been to blame&mdash;to blame! I have kill'd my son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have kill'd him&mdash;but I loved him&mdash;my dear son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May God forgive me!&mdash;I have been to blame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kiss me, my children!'<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Then they clung about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the man was broken with remorse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his love came back a hundredfold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking of William.<br /></span>
<span class="i16">So those four abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within one house together; and as years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went forward, Mary took another mate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dora lived unmarried till her death.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There's that old hag Moll Brown, look, see, just past!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish the ugly sly old witch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would tumble over in the ditch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wouldn't pick her out not very fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't think she's belied, 'tis clear's the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she's a witch if ever there was one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I do know just hereabout of two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or three folk that have learnt what Moll can do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She did, one time, a pretty deal of harm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Farmer Gruff's folks, down at Lower Farm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day, you know, they happen'd to offend her,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Because they would not give or lend her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thing she came to beg or borrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, you know, they soon began to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she'd a-left her evil wish behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She soon bewitch'd them; and she had such power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she did make their milk and ale turn sour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And addle all the eggs their fowls did lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They couldn't fetch the butter in the churn,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The little pigs a-running with the sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did sicken somehow, nobody knew how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fall, and turn their snouts towards the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only give one little grunt and die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the little ducks and chicken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were death-struck while they were a-pickin'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their food, and fell upon their head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flapp'd their wings and dropp'd down dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They couldn't fat the calves; they wouldn't thrive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They couldn't save their lambs alive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sheep all took the rot and gave no wool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their horses fell away to skin and bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And got so weak they couldn't pull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A half a peck of stones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog got dead-alive and drowsy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cat fell sick and wouldn't mousey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the wretched souls went up to bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hag did come and ride them all half dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They used to keep her out o' the house 'tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-nailing up at door a horse's shoe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I've a-heard the farmer's wife did try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive a needle or a pin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In through her old hard wither'd skin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw her blood, a-coming by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she could never fetch a drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bent the pin and broke the needle's top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against her skin, you know, and that, in course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did only make the hag bewitch them worse.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The young man eke that feels his bones with pain opprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he would be a rich old man, to live and lie at rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich old man that sees his end draw on so sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How would he be a boy again to live so much the more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat full oft I smiled, to see how all those three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From boy to man, from man to boy, would chop and change degree.<br /></span>
